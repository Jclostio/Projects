                Living near Whitefish, Montana, means living close to Big
                Mountain. My dad taught me how to ski at a very young age, and
                I've been skiing most winters since. There's nothing better than
                waking up early on a Saturday, gearing up, and driving to the
                mountain on a crisp winter day. Upon arrival, the mountain
                offers incredible scenic beauty and a variety of routes to keep
                us entertained all day.

              <p>
                My sister lives in Alaska, and I had the opportunity to visit
                her and her fianc√© last summer. During the trip, I was able to
                visit Seward, Alaska, where the Resurrection Bay fjord meets the
                mountains creating a stunning view (as seen on the right). There
                are seemingly endless hikes and outdoor activities to enjoy
                during the summer, which, combined with the picturesque
                landscapes, made for the best summer vacation.

                These dogs are among the most comically clumsy creatures around.
                Despite their penchant for mischief, they undeniably add a touch
                of excitement and joy to life. Although both of these retrievers
                look alike, they are actually two completely different bundles
                of joy.
